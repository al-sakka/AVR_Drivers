# AVR MCU Families - MCAL and HAL Drivers

Welcome to the AVR MCU Families Driver Repository! This repository provides a comprehensive collection of Microcontroller Abstraction Layer (MCAL) and Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) drivers for various AVR microcontroller families. Each driver is designed to facilitate the development and deployment of embedded applications using AVR MCUs.

## Repository Contents

### MCAL Drivers
The MCAL (Microcontroller Abstraction Layer) drivers provide low-level access to essential peripherals on AVR MCUs. The following drivers are included:

- **ICU (Input Capture Unit)**: For capturing input signals with precise timing.
- **ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)**: For reading analog signals from sensors and converting them to digital values.
- **GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)**: For configuring and controlling digital input and output pins.
- **SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)**: For high-speed, full-duplex communication with other devices.
- **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)**: For serial communication with other devices.
- **Timers**: For time-based operations such as delays, event timing, and task scheduling.
- **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)**: For generating PWM signals for motor control, LED dimming, and other applications.

### HAL Drivers
The HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) drivers offer a higher-level interface for various peripherals, making it easier to develop applications without needing to handle low-level register configurations. The following drivers are included:

- **LCD**: Driver for interfacing with LCD displays.
- **Keypad**: Driver for interacting with matrix keypads.
- **Ultrasonic**: Driver for ultrasonic distance measurement sensors.

## Getting Started

To start using the drivers in this repository:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/al-sakka/AVR_Drivers
   ```
2. **Navigate to the desired driver**:
   Each driver is located in its respective directory within the repository, along with documentation on how to use it.
   
3. **Integrate the driver into your project**:
   - Include the necessary driver files in your project.
   - Initialize and configure the driver as per the documentation.

## Compatibility

These drivers are compatible with various AVR MCU families. Please refer to each driver's documentation for details on specific supported MCUs and configuration options.
